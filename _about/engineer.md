## Our Profession Has Changed Humanity, but Few Know about It

Without the juris-linguistic contributions of Goldfarb's markup language and Szabo's smart contract language, we would not have the legal environments of the Internet or the Blockchain. Trillions of USD worth of wealth has been generated by the legal relationships formed on the Internet and the Blockchain, despite only a minuscule fraction of the legal community contributing to this body of 'load-bearing' legalese.

This presentation helps bridge the gap between the familiar lawtech and the unfamiliar legal engineering, using the fast-growing network state movement to argue legal engineering will grow quicker-than-expected as a profession to meet 'hypercosmo city-state-of-the-future' demand (and finally address outstanding Internet and Blockchain demand).
