## An Online Apprenticeship School That Explores What It Means to Be a DAO

This season we're offering online classes as well as our hands-on exploratory sessions with students:

* "Digital Legal Literacy Basics": We seek to teach law students and legal professionals how to think computationally by comparing legal reasoning with the logic of code. Each week, core programming concepts, such as assignment vs. equality, data vs. instructions, logic, branching, scope, and iteration, are paired with legal parallels like defined terms, statutes, clauses, and transaction costs. Through hands-on exercises, participants learn to translate legal text into structured data and pseudo-code, building fluency in both legal and computational logic.
* "Legal Engineering Philosophy": Join us to explore the emerging discipline of legal engineering through philosophy, technology, and Charles Goldfarb’s vision of “legal abundance.” Students alternate between conceptual frameworks—such as declarative, imperative, and inductive modes of reasoning—and hands-on explorations of new technologies shaping law. By the end, participants will connect theory with practice, understanding how evolving tools and ideas can expand legal systems toward greater accessibility and scalability.
