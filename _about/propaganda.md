## The Populist Message That Legal Is the Peoplesâ€™ Construct

Legal is the domain of humanity in serious harmony, including life and death reliances.

Yet the easily falsifiable belief is that legal is the domain of lawyers, that to engage with legal is to get a lawyer's permission. 

The cost of legal is:

* high
* hyperinflationary
* scarce
* delayed
* incurred by every industry
* arguably costs far more in total than only legal fees, if we factor in externalities amplification such as chilling effect and opportunity costs
