## IxVenture’s Position on DOM iFrames as Human-Machine <> Digital-Legalese Interfaces

IxVenture is investing in multiple recursive (iFrame) **Document Object Model (DOM) formats** because we believe DOMs represent the **next stage after print-digitized legal formalization: <ins>natively-digital legal formalization</ins>**.

By supporting the development of **multiple legally-regimented DOM formats**, IxVenture is building toward a world where organizational and contractual logic can be expressed as interoperable objects.

Many of the DOM stacks we're building use the Hierarchical Script-Database "**SeedTree**" kernel solution invented by IxVenture co-founder, bestape. (Compare: a DOM kernel has a framework's amount of impact in a compression smaller than a library).

From this object orientation, we believe very much that iFrames should be expressed as NFT interdata objects.
