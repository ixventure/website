## Simple but Powerful dShell Robots with GPIO Are Remote Vending Machine Microinstances

Cybernetics that fold **virtual and physical** realities again-and-again, **recursively**, offer novel creator economy opportunities.

An in-frame collectible tabletop robot the entertainer lets livestreamers control, for instance.

It's much easier to deploy **recursive** solutions on **permissionless** networks, hence Web3.

Build out **ERC-7827** with a fun and inexpensive spectacle single-board computer.

### The Friendly Ghost in the dShell
