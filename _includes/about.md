## Our Sovtech Investment Category

Solutions touch on existing investment categories — **AI**, **blockchain**, **legaltech** — but the common **deeptech** category is sovtech: 

* **Sovtech** reinforces our rights to _sovereignty_ along the entire **individual → multistate** vertical, because a break anywhere along the vertical can lead to catastrophe!

## What Are We Obsessed With?

Continuing the inventor-class lawyer traditions of **juris doctor linguists** who have *hyperdeflated* legal costs worldwide:

* **Goldfarb**, the Internet's grandpa by inventing **Markup Language** _digital legal formalization_
  
* **Szabo**, the Blockchain's grandpa by inventing **Smart-Contract Language** _digital legal formalization_

Note that the Internet and the Blockchain are both legal expressions. They are a "Commons" of real-world relationships formalized through XML, Solidity, etc.

## Why Are We Obsessed with This?

Despite (and, counter-intuitively, because of) Goldfarb & Szabo hyperdeflating some legal costs worldwide, most "last-mile" legal costs are hyperinflationary _and_ scarce nowadays:

* A world that enjoys legal abundance is **a humanitarian world filled with peace & joy**. (As we now enjoy with transport abundance compared to the "oregon trail" scarcity of 200 years ago).
  
* Our belief is that **last-mile legal costs will hyperdeflate once a critical mass of lawyers become literate** in the digital legal formalizations of markup language and smart contract language, which is an evolution in "fastidious literature' made by lawyers for lawyers so we can better trace out the law.
