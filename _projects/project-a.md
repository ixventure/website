## Overview
Project A is an initiative where we’re exploring how artificial intelligence can help people **work smarter, create faster, and solve complex problems**.  

## Goals
- Build a prototype that demonstrates real-world value.  
- Test with early users and gather feedback.  
- Share learnings openly as we progress.  

## Progress
- ✅ Defined the problem space.  
- ✅ Built an early prototype.  
- 🔄 Currently testing with small groups.  
- ⏳ Next: polish and prepare for broader release.  

## Media
Here’s a first look at the interface:
