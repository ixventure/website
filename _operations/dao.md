## Though Illiterate, We Need Lawyers Literate before DAOs Can Truly Exist

Only the vast creative expression of jurisprudence expressed as software experiences can manifest the promise of DAO elegance.

We believe thta legal wrappers are wrapping digital legal formalism in a form of fixation with negligently narrow latency, thus stunting the maturation of legal literary works to everyone's great detriment. Wrappers might be triage, but they are no alternative to a critical mass of lawyers making the time-is-of-the-essence effort to become literate in the languages invented by lawyers for lawyers: markup languages and smart contract languages.
